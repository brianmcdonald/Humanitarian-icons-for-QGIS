Humanitarian Icons for QGIS
=========

These icons are based on the work of [Dan Joseph](https://github.com/danbjoseph/map-icons/) which converted the original [UNOCA Humanitarian icons](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/world-humanitarian-and-country-icons-2012) to SVG.

The XML stylesheets in the second link appear to no longer work in the latest version of QGIS. The icons in this repository have an added attribute `param(fill)` which allows QGIS to customise the fill colour of the icons.

To add these icons to QGIS click `preferences`, `system` and add the location of the icons to your SVG paths. 

Contact bmcdonald@iom.int if you with to have additional QGIS-friendly icons added
